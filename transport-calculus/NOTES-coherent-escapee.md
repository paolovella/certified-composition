# The ◊-side attempt — research note

Status: **attempt, not closed.** This note records the state of the ◊-side construction of
an escapee over the coherent fiber order `D_coh(e)` — what is proved, what is reduced, and
the precise point of obstruction. Prose rigor: careful sketch; nothing here is
machine-checked (ω₁ does not fit a mathlib-free repo), and claims are graded accordingly.

Throughout: `e = ⟨e_α : α < ω₁⟩` is coherent (`e_α : α → ℕ`, `e_α =* e_β↾α`), normalized to
values `≥ 1`; `D_coh(e) := Σ_α {s : α → ℕ ∣ s =* e_α}` with the pointwise order on the
smaller domain. A *system* is a monotone bounded-slice constraint family (realized by
val/img pairs); a *dominator* is a monotone `φ` with `φ(t) ⊒` every slice; an *escapee* is
a legal system with no dominator. A *representative system* ("reps") is `⟨ρ_α : α < ω₁⟩`
with `ρ_α =* e_α` and `ρ_α ≤ ρ_β↾α` pointwise for `α < β` — a level-monotone choice of
fiber representatives.

## 1. Two ZFC lemmas (proofs complete at prose rigor)

**Lemma 1 (level-preserving systems always factor).** If every requirement's level is ≤ its
threshold's level, `φ(t) := t ∨ sup S(t)` (pointwise sup on `dom t`) is a dominator: the
slice bound puts `sup S(t) ≤* e_{λ_t}`, so the value stays in the fiber; monotonicity of
`S` gives monotonicity of `φ` with no floor-mixing. *An escapee must raise levels.*

**Lemma 2 (reps ⇒ everything factors).** Given reps `ρ`, the repaired overshoot
`φ(t) := (μ_t, max(ext_ρ(t), sup S(t), ρ_{μ_t}))` — `μ_t` the sup of levels in the slice,
`ext_ρ` extending `t` by `ρ`-values — is a dominator for *every* legal system: each of the
three terms is monotone, the floor terms nest *exactly* (that is what reps are), and the
slice bound keeps everything in the fiber. Corollary: trivial `e` has reps
(`ρ_α := max(e_α, E↾α)`), so **triviality ⇒ factors-everything**; the escapee, if any,
lives strictly on nontrivial sequences.

## 2. The ◊ theorem (sketch-complete)

**Theorem (◊).** There is a coherent sequence `e` with values `≥ 1` admitting **no
representative system** — hence (Lemma 2's route) no canonical dominator repairs exist.

*Sketch.* Build `e` by recursion with a ◊-sequence guessing (codes of) partial rep systems.
Successors: `e_{β+1} := e_β⌢⟨1⟩`. At limit `β`, fix a ladder `β_n ↑ β` and the default glue
`ẽ_β` (block `[β_n, β_{n+1})` copies `e_{β_{n+1}}`). If the guess decodes to a level-monotone
partial system `ρ↾β`, let `P := sup_{α<β} ρ_α` pointwise. If `P` is infinite anywhere, any
`ρ_β` is already dead. Otherwise the constantly-0 set of `P` meets each initial segment
finitely (each `ρ_α =* e_α ≥ 1` off finite), so each block contains a point `ξ_n` with
`P(ξ_n) ≥ 1`; set `e_β := ẽ_β` except `e_β(ξ_n) := 0` for all `n`. Coherence survives —
finitely many `ξ_n` below any `α < β`. Any candidate `ρ_β` must satisfy
`ρ_β(ξ_n) ≥ P(ξ_n) ≥ 1 > 0 = e_β(ξ_n)` at infinitely many points, so `ρ_β ≁* e_β`: the
partial system cannot pass `β`. A total rep system is guessed correctly at stationarily
many `β` (standard coding + club argument), and dies there. ∎

Open side-question: the walk sequences (`ρ₁`) may *already* lack reps in ZFC — worth
checking against Todorcevic's unboundedness properties before assuming ◊ is needed here.

## 3. The obstruction: pressure vs. legality, and the "+1 trap"

Everything below is where the construction stops being a proof and becomes a reduction.

- **Pressure requires boundable infinity.** A dominator is only cornered where
  monotonicity focuses infinitely many committed constraints at one point — i.e. along an
  *infinite boundable* threshold family. Unbounded families exert no pressure (no element
  sits above them to be constrained).
- **Legality then defuses naive encodings.** Bounded slices force the requirements over
  any boundable family to have pointwise sup `≤*` the local floor; fibers absorb finite
  defects; so the focused constraint is always satisfiable *pointwise*. Encoding
  ladder-system colorings as above-floor spikes (`+1` over a reserved track) makes the
  slice unbounded the moment pressure exists: **illegal exactly when useful**. This
  killed every direct transcription of the classical ◊ uniformization failures.
- **The successor-push system is legal** — `Σ_succ := {((β, e_β), (β+1, e_β⌢⟨1⟩))}` has
  bounded slices (the image reuses the threshold's own function; values ≥ 1 absorb the new
  coordinate; an earlier version of this analysis wrongly called it illegal via floor
  accumulation — the defect-free choice of image avoids that). It forces every dominator
  to raise levels cofinally. But its constraint points `(β, e_β)` form an antichain, and
  antichains transmit no coherence.
- **Self-obstruction.** Turning antichain values into coherent data needs a threshold
  *chain* through the fibers; constructing an ω₁-chain of fiber elements requires exactly
  a representative system — the object whose nonexistence powers the kill. Every
  extraction route attempted (joins of canonical points, recursive threshold chains,
  club-restricted reps) circles back to this: **the kill needs reps to aim itself, and
  no-reps is the ammunition.**

## 4. The reduced open core

The ◊-side attempt therefore closes iff the following bridge closes:

> **Bridge (open).** Over the ◊-sequence of §2 (or any no-reps coherent sequence), does
> some legal system have no dominator at all? Equivalently: does "every legal system
> factors" imply the existence of a representative system?

Lemma 2 is the converse (reps ⇒ factors-everything). If the bridge holds, ◊ produces the
escapee and the transport line's residual is **consistently inhabited**. If the bridge
fails — if non-canonical dominators can always be assembled without reps — then the
dip-coherence freedom (upper bounds may dip below the floor at finite sets, chosen
per-point) is strong enough to dodge every rep-shaped obstruction, and the suspicion flips
toward ZFC-factoring of `D_coh(e)`. The repeated satisfiability wall of §3 is weak evidence
for the second reading; the Aronszajn shape of the order is evidence for the first. Both
readings are consistent with everything proved here.

What would decide it: (a) a direct construction of a dominator for `Σ_succ` over the ◊
sequence — this must route monotone values through the fibers *without* a rep chain, i.e.
exploit dips essentially, and any success would likely generalize to all legal systems; or
(b) a second ◊-diagonalization *against dominators of `Σ_succ` directly* — the guessed
object is then `φ↾D_β` (legal by a club argument), and the kill must place later structure
conflicting with committed values; §3 shows the conflict cannot be requirement-borne
(legality) nor boundedness-borne (monotone maps send bounded to bounded), leaving only the
fiber-membership of limit values — precisely where §2's kill operates, but now the guessed
`φ` need not be rep-shaped, and the lowering trick needs `P ≥ 1` on a set the adversary
controls, which a dip-happy `φ` may deny. That last sentence is the exact face of the
wall.

## 5. Verdict

◊ demonstrably destroys every *canonical* (rep-mediated) dominator; whether it destroys
some system's *every* dominator is exactly the Bridge. The attempt stands as: two ZFC
lemmas, one ◊ theorem, one legal pressure system (`Σ_succ`), and one sharply-located open
bridge — rather than a claimed independence result. The honest suspicion is unchanged in
direction but sharpened in location: the escapee question over `D_coh(e)` is equivalent to
a rep-existence/uniformization principle whose ◊-side needs one more genuinely new idea —
dip-side pressure — that no encoding so far supplies.
